# simple-to-do

This app is "maximally minimalistic" TODO app as can be. But it has some nice features:
* the app saves your todos in a browser, so you can close and open it without losing anything
* you can "Add it to Home screen" with your browser and the app will add its icon to your phone's Home screen and will work as a real application (even without the Internet)
